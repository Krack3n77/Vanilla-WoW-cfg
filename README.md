# Config script for Elysium WoW 

## Usage [Windows]:

1. Download a ZIP of the repository (**Clone or Download** button, Download ZIP)
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Copy the *Elysium-WoW-cfg.cmd* from the Windows directory in the extracted zip to you Vanilla World of Warcraft directory.
4. Double click *Elysium-WoW-cfg.cmd* to run.

The script will prompt you:
* for which realm you want configured
* whether you want unnecessary executables disabled (to avoid firing up the downloader by accident)
* to setup a shortcut to *Elysium Project WoW* on your desktop

After the configuration is complete, there is a final prompt to check MD5 hashes of your install. This can be used to make sure your installed files are correct for playing on Elysium.

**NOTE:** The script may be sandboxed by some AV/Firewall applications, in which case changes made will be lost. If this is the case on your machine open a command prompt (shift--right-click on your WoW folder in Explorer, and select *OPen command window here*), and run *Elysium-WoW-cfg.cmd* from the command line.
